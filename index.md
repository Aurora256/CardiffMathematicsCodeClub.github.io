_Three Functions for the Windows under the sky,
    
Seven for the Linux in their halls of stone,

Nine for Apple doomed to die,

One for the Dark Lord on his dark kernel

In the Land of Arch where the Json lie.

One Function to rule them all, One Function to find them,

One Function to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

In the Land of Arch where the Json lie._

Code Club is a place where like minded people who are passionate about programming can get together
and hang out, talk about coding in general and work on any projects that they have
in mind, whether it be solo or part of a team. Code Club is the ideal place to
improve your skills as a programmer while enjoying the pleasant company of others who share your interests.

Can't wait to come along? Well we meet every Thursday in M/0.33 in the School of Mathematics building at 16:00.
