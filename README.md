# Cardiff School of Mathematics Code Club

A repository for the Cardiff School of Mathematics Code Club: an extra curricular club open to all.

Website here - http://cardiffmathematicscodeclub.github.io/

Meeting time: Thursdays at 16:00 in room M/0.33.

NOTE - There might be some CSS issues with the background when editing locally, from CSS url issues.

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to the code club website, we need as much
help as possible in making this the best site on the internet! Below is
a short list of tasks that need completing:

    - Pages that give a short introduction to most of the popular programming languages
      would be good. These pages should give a should give a short piece on the history
      of the language, what it is used for giving well known programs as examples where possible.
      Also include a "Hello world!" snippet (see below) and some links to further resources, tutorials etc.

    - We should think about maintaining a list of past and current projects that have been worked
      on at code club. Linking to source code and/or demos when possible

    - We will always need help making the site looking as good as possible

    - Maybe we could go for a terminal theme? Making the text boxes look like output from
      terminal commands, e.g. the menu could be the output from a "$ ls" command. We could
      also look at experimenting with CSS animations to add blinking cursors, typing commands etc.
      Or of anyone has other ideas then I'm open to discussion :)
