In the summer semester for the Computing for Mathematics module we were required to create 'companies' of 4. 
The goal was for us to create a 'product' which involes programming and mathematics. 
For this our company decided to make an mobile app, to aid with learning mathematics through giving content and quiz. 

Once we have decided to make the app I looked at varies [GUI frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) based on python which we could use.
From this list we decided that [Kivy](http://kivy.org/) would be best suited for what we required.
