            <p>
                There are more programming languages than stars in the galaxy... OK
                <i>slight</i> exaggeration but there are a lot of them. Created for any
                possible purpose imaginable from building video games to driving rovers on Mars or
                simply trying to <a href="languages/brainfk.html">confuse</a> the programmer using them!
            </p>
