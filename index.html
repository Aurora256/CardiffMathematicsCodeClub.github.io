                Code Club is a place where like minded people who are passionate about programming can get together
                and hang out, talk about coding in general and work on any projects that they have
                in mind, whether it be solo or part of a team. Code Club is the ideal place to
                improve your skills as a programmer while enjoying the pleasant company of others who share your interests.
