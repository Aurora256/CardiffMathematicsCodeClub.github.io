<h1>Cardiff School of Mathematics Code Club</h1>

<p class="well quote">
    <i>Three Functions for the Windows under the sky,<br>
    Seven for the Linux in their halls of stone,<br>
    Nine for Apple doomed to die,<br>
    One for the Dark Lord on his dark kernel<br>
    In the Land of Arch where the Json lie.<br>
    One Function to rule them all, One Function to find them,<br>
    One Function to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>
    In the Land of Arch where the Json lie.</i>
